My demanding job left me with zero time or energy for my own goals.

So I stopped looking for time at the end of the day and started creating it at the beginning. The 4:30 AM start isn't about hustle; it's about reclaiming my future, one quiet morning at a time.

This is the system. My new post explains how it works.
