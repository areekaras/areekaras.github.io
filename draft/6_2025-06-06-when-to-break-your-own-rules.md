For years, I operated on a firm, self-imposed rule: "Travel the world, but always come back home." My friends in Singapore would occasionally mention job opportunities, but I never pursued them. I didn't want to be an expat; I wanted to be a traveler who always had a home base in India to return to.

This rule served me well, until it didn't.

## The Trap

After I left the high-paying job I had landed post-break, the tech recession hit hard. A dream opportunity that would have let me work from anywhere as a freelancer suddenly evaporated. At the same time, my marriage was being arranged. I felt my options narrowing. The freedom I had worked so hard to create felt like it was slipping away.

For the first time in a long while, I felt trapped. My rules and my reality were in direct conflict.

> Sometimes, the principles that guide you to one level of success become the very walls that prevent you from reaching the next. The trick is knowing when a rule has become a limitation.

## Breaking The Rule

Staring at my dwindling options, I realized my long-standing rule about not moving abroad was now a form of self-sabotage. It was a preference, not a necessity.

So, I did the one thing I had always resisted. I picked up the phone and called my friends in Singapore. I asked them to keep an eye out for me. They shared an opportunity, I went through the process, and I got the job.

It wasn't the "work-from-anywhere" dream I had envisioned, but it was a lifeline that turned into the single biggest step-up in my career. That one decision to break my own rule led directly to where I am today, working in a global hub, with professional and financial growth that has been truly exponential.

Our plans are important, but our ability to adapt when they break is what defines our journey.
