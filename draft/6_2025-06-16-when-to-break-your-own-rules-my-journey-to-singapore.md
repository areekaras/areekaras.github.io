I've always operated with a core philosophy: I choose my job; the employer doesn't choose me. This isn't arrogance; it's a deep-seated belief in my ability to deliver value and to continuously improve. It's why I've quit jobs without another offer lined up. I have a firm belief that if a role exists, I can earn it through persistent effort.

This philosophy was governed by a set of personal rules. One of the firmest was this: Travel the world, but your home base is India. I resisted all suggestions to become an expat. I was a traveler, not an emigrant.

These principles gave me confidence and direction. Until a sudden market shift put them to the ultimate test.

## When the Plan Evaporates

After leaving the high-paying remote job, I pursued what I believed was my ideal role: a flexible, international-level freelance opportunity. I had applied once during my career break and failed, but this time, after another round of interviews, we had even discussed the package. I felt I was on the verge of securing the ultimate freedom I had worked for.

Then, silence. The tech recession had hit, and the opportunity vanished without a trace. The dream dissolved, and for the first time in a long time, a sense of panic set in. My options were narrowing, fast.

## When a Rule Becomes a Cage

My core principles had led me to incredible growth, but now one of them—my rule about not moving abroad—was becoming a cage. It was limiting my options at the exact moment I needed them most.

> Sometimes, the very principles that guide you to one level of success become the walls that prevent you from reaching the next. True growth lies in knowing when a rule has outlived its usefulness.

Realizing this, I made a calculated decision. I broke the rule. I picked up the phone, called my friends in Singapore, and asked them to keep an eye out for opportunities. A role appeared, I interviewed, and I got the job.

## The Right Path at the Right Time

Upon arriving in Singapore, I was struck by the hyper-efficient environment and global exposure. A part of me thought, "I should have done this years ago."

But another, wiser part knew the truth. The long, difficult path I had taken was precisely what prepared me for this moment. If I had arrived earlier, I might have feared losing my job in a new country. But the journey through debt, doubt, and discipline had made me fearless. My anchor wasn't a place or a company; it was my process. If a place isn't right for you, you learn, you earn, and you move on.

As the book "Who Moved My Cheese?" illustrates, I've always identified with the mice who are constantly seeking new sources of nourishment. When the world changes—through recessions, layoffs, or the rise of AI—the only strategy is to adapt and move with the tide. That’s why my answer to "Where do you work?" is always, "Right *now*, I'm in Singapore."

My prologue ends here, but my journey of adaptation is just beginning.
