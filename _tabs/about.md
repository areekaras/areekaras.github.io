# The Full-Stack Metamorphosis

Welcome to my corner of the web! This is the place where I'm documenting my evolution from a seasoned iOS engineer to an AI-assisted full-stack developer.

![Shibili Areekara](/assets/img/profile.jpg){: width="300" height="300" .w-50 .left}
**I'm Shibili, a Senior iOS Engineer by trade, now partnering with AI to explore the vast world of full-stack development, one line of code at a time.**

In the daytime, I architect and build scalable, modular iOS apps 👨‍💻 for major financial institutions, with **8+ years of experience** shipping features to millions of users across Southeast Asia. By night, I switch gears—trading some Swift for stacks and teaming up with my AI co-pilot 🤖 to tackle personal projects and document the entire expedition on this blog.

My flagship initiative is a secret for now, but it's a cross-platform **Personal Management System (PMS)** that's my proving ground for **mastering advanced SwiftUI and full-stack integration with Supabase**.

> This blog is a real-time log of that journey—a blend of **deep-dive technical solutions and the candid, unfiltered process** of learning something new. It's about the 'aha!' moments and the 'why didn't that work?' head-scratchers.

Learning should be a shared adventure.

### Let's Build Something Great

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations where I can bring my expertise in iOS development and my passion for building modern, full-stack solutions to the table.

If you have an interesting project or a role where my skills would be a great fit, I'd love to hear from you.
