"I don't have time."

It's the most common and legitimate reason we don't pursue our biggest goals. Between a demanding full-time job, family, and life itself, where are you supposed to find the hours to learn a new skill, let alone build a complex, full-stack application from scratch?

For a long time, that was my excuse too. My current company culture is great, but it leaves me with very little energy at the end of the day for deep, focused work.

So, I stopped looking for time at the end of my day. I started creating it at the beginning.

## The 4:30 AM Club

My alarm goes off at 4:30 AM. After a quick workout, from about 5:30 AM to 8:45 AM, my time is entirely my own. This is my sacred, uninterrupted window for building my future. This is where the real work on my "AI Expedition" happens.

This is when I dive into my Personal Management System (PMS) project, wrestling with SwiftUI, connecting to a Supabase backend, and prompting AI for help. This is my lab.

> It's not about finding motivation. It's about building a system so disciplined that motivation becomes irrelevant. The progress itself becomes the fuel.

## One Brick at a Time

This routine isn't about hustle culture or burnout. It's about a simple, powerful principle: **consistency.**

I truly believe that massive, life-changing results don't come from one heroic, 18-hour coding session. They come from laying one brick perfectly, every single day. The 4:30 AM start is just my way of making sure I always have time to lay that one brick.

This discipline has worked for me in the past, leading to breakthroughs I never thought possible. I'm betting on it again. Waking up before the sun isn't a sacrifice; it's an investment.
