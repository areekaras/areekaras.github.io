If you've landed on my homepage, you know the title of my blog is "My AI Expedition." This is the first official entry in that logbook. It’s not just about code; it’s about the "why" behind it.

## The Comfort Zone

For the last eight years, I've built a career I'm proud of as an iOS Engineer. I've had the privilege of architecting features for high-stakes apps across industries like banking and healthcare, used by millions. I grew comfortable—perhaps *too* comfortable—in the world of Swift and Apple's ecosystem. By all accounts, it's a great place to be.

But a few years ago, something shifted.

> The real thrill—the real kick in life for me—is in the steep, sometimes-scary, climb of learning something new.

It started with two catalysts: a solo trip across India that completely changed my perspective on life, and a project that forced me to learn **ReactJS** from scratch. I realized then that the comfort zone isn't just a plateau; it's a dangerous place.

## The New Mission

That "itch" has led me here. My new expedition is to evolve from a specialist into an **AI-assisted full-stack developer.**

My vehicle for this journey is a personal project I'm building from the ground up: a cross-platform Personal Management System using **SwiftUI** and **Supabase**.

I know this path requires immense discipline. That's why my days now start at **4:30 AM**. In those quiet hours before the world wakes up, I'm putting in the work—one brick, one line of code, one step at a time. It’s a principle that has paid off for me before in ways I could have never imagined (and I promise, I'll tell you that story another time).

## What to Expect Here

This blog is where I'll be brutally honest about the process. You'll read about my mental fights, my technical roadblocks, my breakthroughs with AI, and what it truly takes to re-tool your brain for a new challenge.

I've learned that you can't wait for the right opportunity to come to you; you have to **build yourself into the person who is ready for it.**

This is me, building.

Thanks for joining the expedition. Stay tuned.
